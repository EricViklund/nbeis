title = {The Mechanism of Electropolishing of Niobium in Hydrofluoric–Sulfuric Acid Electrolyte},
journal = {Journal of The Electrochemical Society},
abstract = {Niobium surfaces are commonly electropolished in an effort to obtain optimal smoothness for high-field superconducting radio-frequency cavity applications. We report the use of controlled electrochemical analysis techniques to characterize electropolishing of Nb in a sulfuric and hydrofluoric acid electrolyte. Through the use of a reference electrode, we are able to clearly distinguish the anode and cathode polarization potentials as well as the electrolyte voltage drop, which together sum to the applied power supply voltage. We then identify the temperature and HF concentration dependence of each potential. We also report the use of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) on this system. EIS results are consistent with the compact salt film mechanism for niobium electropolishing (EP) in this electrolyte and are not consistent with either the porous salt film or the absorbate-acceptor mechanism. Microscopic understanding of the basic Nb EP mechanism is expected to provide an appropriate foundation with which to optimize the preparation of high-field niobium cavity surfaces.}

journal = {Journal of The Electrochemical Society},
abstract = {A high-resolution impedance study of the hydrogen oxidation in  (yttria-stabilized zirconia) cermet anodes has been realized in consideration of a broad range of operating conditions (temperature and partial pressure of fuel gas components , , , He). A major problem in this respect concerns the origin and physical interpretation of empirical equivalent circuits used to fit the experimental data. We applied a two-stage approach for the evaluation of the impedance data: (i) at first, by the deconvolution of a distribution function of relaxation times (DRT), four different processes and their characteristic relaxation times have been identified. Two processes at frequencies  represent a gas-conversion process or, respectively, a gas diffusion, whereas two processes at higher frequencies  are associated with the electro-oxidation of hydrogen at active sites, including the charge transfer reaction and the ionic transport. (ii) Subsequently, the last mentioned processes were fitted to a “transmission line” model describing the electronic and ionic transport properties of the  cermet. The high resolution of the DRT combined with the numeric accuracy of the complex nonlinear least square (CNLS) fit enabled us to determine (i) the effective ionic conductivity of the  cermet, (ii) the spatial extension of the electrochemically active area adjacent to the electrolyte/electrode interface, and (iii) the charge transfer resistance and its thermal activation energy.}

abstract = {The impedance of anode-supported single cells [ yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) anode;  cathode; 8YSZ electrolyte; area ] was characterized in a broad measuring range of temperature and air/fuel gas composition. The data has been analyzed by calculating the distribution function of relaxation times (DRTs). DRT computations enabled us to separate five different loss mechanisms occurring inside the cathode and anode without the need of an equivalent circuit. Two processes exhibit a systematic dependency on changes in the oxygen partial pressure of the cathode gas and thus can be attributed to diffusional and electrochemical losses on the cathode side. The remaining three processes are very sensitive to changes in the fuel gas but are not affected by variations of the cathode gas. These resistances are classified as a gas diffusion polarization within the anode–substrate and as an electro-oxidation reaction at the triple-phase boundary, respectively.}

abstract = {Linear electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and in particular its representation of distribution of relaxation time (DRT), enables the identification of the number of processes and their nature involved in electrochemical cells. With the advantage of high frequency resolution, DRT has recently drawn increasing attention for applications in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). However, the method of DRT reconstruction is not yet presented clearly in terms of what mathematical treatments and theoretical assumptions have been made. Here we present unambiguously a method to reconstruct DRT function of impedance based on Tikhonov regularization. By using the synthetic impedances and analytic DRT functions of RQ element, generalized finite length Warburg element, and Gerischer element with physical quantities representative to those of SOFC processes, we show that the quality of DRT reconstruction is sensitive to the sampling points per decade (ppd) of frequency from the impedance measurement. The robustness of the DRT reconstruction to resist noise imbedded in impedance data and numerical calculations can be accomplished by optimizing the weighting factor λ according to well defined criterion.}

The FT method was written in the programming package ‘Borland Delphi’, for the Tikhonov regularization (TR) a freely available MatLab application (DRTtools) was used. The CNLS-fit was performed with the EqCwin95 software. Where possible the DFRT's were compared with an exact, calculated τ-domain representation of the model impedance. Practical use of the DFRT is demonstrated in the analysis of the impedance of a Ca3Co4O9+δ-Ce0.9Gd0.1O0.95 composite cathode (CCO-CGO). The comparison shows that the FT and TR methods have problems in presenting the sharp and asymmetric peak of the DFRT of a Gerischer dispersion. In that case the multiple-(RQ) CNLS-fit presents too many peaks. Reconstruction of the impedance from the DFRT and comparing it to the original data set is a useful validation procedure for the DFRT.}

ABSTRACT = {The distribution of relaxation times (DRT) analysis offers a model-free approach for a detailed investigation of electrochemical impedance spectra. Typically, the calculation of the distribution function is an ill-posed problem requiring regularization methods which are strongly parameter-dependent. Before statements on measurement data can be made, a process parameter study is crucial for analyzing the impact of the individual parameters on the distribution function. The optimal regularization parameter is determined together with the number of discrete time constants. Furthermore, the regularization term is investigated with respect to its mathematical background. It is revealed that the algorithm and its handling of constraints and the optimization function significantly determine the result of the DRT calculation. With optimized parameters, detailed information on the investigated system can be obtained. As an example of a complex impedance spectrum, a commercial Nickel–Manganese–Cobalt–Oxide (NMC) lithium-ion pouch cell is investigated. The DRT allows the investigation of the SOC dependency of the charge transfer reactions, solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and the solid state diffusion of both anode and cathode. For the quantification of the single polarization contributions, a peak analysis algorithm based on Gaussian distribution curves is presented and applied.},

abstract = {Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is widely used in battery analysis as it is simple to implement and non-destructive. However, the data provided is a global representation of all electrochemical processes within the cell and much useful information is ambiguous or inaccessible when using traditional analysis techniques. This is a major challenge when EIS is used to analyse systems with complex cell chemistries, like lithium-sulfur (Li-S), one of the strongest candidates to supersede conventional Li-ion batteries. Here we demonstrate the application of distribution of relaxation times (DRT) analysis for quantitative deconvolution of EIS spectra from Li-S batteries, revealing the contributions of (eight) distinct electrode processes to the total cell polarisation. The DRT profile is shown to be strongly dependent on cell state-of-charge, offering a route to automated and on-board analysis of Li-S cells.}

abstract = {Supercapacitors are often modelled using electrical equivalent circuits with a limited number of branches. However, the limited number of branches often cannot explain long-term dynamics, and one therefore has to resort to more computationally challenging basic models governing diffusion and drift of ions. Here, it is shown that consistent modelling of a supercapacitor can be done in a straightforward manner by introducing a dynamic equivalent circuit model that naturally allows a large number or a continuous distribution of time constants, both in time and frequency domains. Such a model can be used to explain the most common features of a supercapacitor in a consistent manner. In the time domain, it is shown that the time-dependent charging rate and the self-discharge of a supercapacitor can both be interpreted in this model with either a few or a continuous distribution of relaxation times. In the frequency domain, the impedance spectrum allows one to extract a distribution of relaxation times. The unified model presented here may help visualizing how the distribution of relaxation times or frequencies govern the behaviour of a supercapacitor under varying circumstances.}
