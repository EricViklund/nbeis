Wagner's treatment of the distribution of relaxation times in dielectrics is reviewed; the effect of the density of distribution upon the frequency variation of the dielectric constant and dielectric loss factor is discussed; and a graphical method of evaluating the constants of Wagner's equation from experimental data is described. These constants have been evaluated for a number of typical dielectrics, and the frequency variations of the dielectric constant and dielectric loss factor as computed from Wagner's equations and from the simple equations for a single relaxation time are compared with the observed behavior. The quantitative correlation obtained between Wagner's equations and the experimental data investigated is viewed as a confirmation of Wagner's theory of a statistical distribution of relaxation times in dielectrics.}",

In contrast, a cutout sample from the 120 ∘C baked cavity shows a much larger λ\\&gt;100 nm and a depth dependent mean free path, likely due to gradient in vacancy concentration.

    abstract = "{Many future particle accelerators require hundreds of superconducting radiofrequency (SRF) cavities operating with high duty factor. The large dynamic heat load of the cavities causes the cryogenic plant to make up a significant part of the overall cost of the facility. This contribution can be reduced by replacing standard niobium cavities with ones coated with a low-dissipation superconductor such as Nb3Sn. In this paper, we present results for single cell cavities coated with Nb3Sn at Cornell. Five coatings were carried out, showing that at 4.2 K, high Q0 out to medium fields was reproducible, resulting in an average quench field of 14 MV/m and an average 4.2 K Q0 at quench of 8 × 109. In each case, the peak surface magnetic field at quench was well above Hc1, showing that it is not a limiting field in these cavities. The coating with the best performance had a quench field of 17 MV/m, exceeding gradient requirements for state-of-the-art high duty factor SRF accelerators. It is also shown that—taking into account the thermodynamic efficiency of the cryogenic plant—the 4.2 K Q0 values obtained meet the AC power consumption requirements of state-of-the-art high duty factor accelerators, making this a proof-of-principle demonstration for Nb3Sn cavities in future applications.}",

Meanwhile, an enhancement of the sensitivity to trapped magnetic field is typically observed for such cavities. In this paper, we conduct a systematic study on these different components contributing to the total surface resistance as a function of different levels of dissolved nitrogen, in comparison with standard surface treatments for niobium resonators. Adding these results together, we are able to show which is the optimum surface treatment that maximizes the Q-factor of superconducting niobium resonators as a function of expected trapped magnetic field in the cavity walls. These results also provide insights on the physics behind the change in the field dependence of the Mattis-Bardeen surface resistance, and of the trapped magnetic vortex induced losses in superconducting niobium resonators.}",

To recognize the physical processes behind the losses in the accelerator modules, it is required to address not only the observed improvements but also the degradation occurring after different surface treatments. Here, we report on microscopic and spectroscopic studies of several cutouts from an extremely well performing cavity, which showed a systematic degradation after modified surface treatments and annealing conditions. Our results suggest that an abundance of low-angle grain boundaries surrounding the small sized grains can be related to the local superconductivity breakdown at high accelerating field gradients.

ABSTRACT = {The distribution of relaxation times (DRT) analysis offers a model-free approach for a detailed investigation of electrochemical impedance spectra. Typically, the calculation of the distribution function is an ill-posed problem requiring regularization methods which are strongly parameter-dependent. Before statements on measurement data can be made, a process parameter study is crucial for analyzing the impact of the individual parameters on the distribution function. The optimal regularization parameter is determined together with the number of discrete time constants. Furthermore, the regularization term is investigated with respect to its mathematical background. It is revealed that the algorithm and its handling of constraints and the optimization function significantly determine the result of the DRT calculation. With optimized parameters, detailed information on the investigated system can be obtained. As an example of a complex impedance spectrum, a commercial Nickel–Manganese–Cobalt–Oxide (NMC) lithium-ion pouch cell is investigated. The DRT allows the investigation of the SOC dependency of the charge transfer reactions, solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and the solid state diffusion of both anode and cathode. For the quantification of the single polarization contributions, a peak analysis algorithm based on Gaussian distribution curves is presented and applied.},

abstract = {Three methods for obtaining a Distribution (Function) of Relaxation Times (DFRT) are compared, Fourier transform (FT), Tikhonov regularization (TR) and a multiple-(RQ) CNLS-fit. The FT method was written in the programming package ‘Borland Delphi’, for the Tikhonov regularization (TR) a freely available MatLab application (DRTtools) was used. The CNLS-fit was performed with the EqCwin95 software. Where possible the DFRT's were compared with an exact, calculated τ-domain representation of the model impedance. Practical use of the DFRT is demonstrated in the analysis of the impedance of a Ca3Co4O9+δ-Ce0.9Gd0.1O0.95 composite cathode (CCO-CGO). The comparison shows that the FT and TR methods have problems in presenting the sharp and asymmetric peak of the DFRT of a Gerischer dispersion. In that case the multiple-(RQ) CNLS-fit presents too many peaks. Reconstruction of the impedance from the DFRT and comparing it to the original data set is a useful validation procedure for the DFRT.}

and their variation with A15 composition, morphology and strain state},
journal = {Superconductor Science and Technology},
abstract = {Significant efforts can be found throughout the literature to optimize the current-carrying capacity of Nb3Sn  superconducting wires. The achievable transport current density in wires depends on the A15 composition, morphology and strain state. The A15 sections in wires contain, due to compositional inhomogeneities resulting from solid-state diffusion A15 formation reactions, a distribution of superconducting properties. The A15 grain size can be different from wire to wire, and is also not necessarily homogeneous across the A15 regions. Strain is always present in composite wires, and the strain state changes as a result of thermal contraction differences and Lorentz forces in magnet systems. To optimize the transport properties, it is thus required to identify how composition, grain size and strain state influence the superconducting properties. This is not possible accurately in inhomogeneous and spatially complex systems such as wires. This article therefore gives an overview of the available literature on simplified, well-defined (quasi-)homogeneous laboratory samples. After more than 50 years of research on superconductivity in Nb3Sn, a significant amount of results are available, but these are scattered over a multitude of publications. Two reviews exist on the basic properties of A15 materials in general, but no specific review for Nb3Sn  is available. This article is intended to provide such an overview. It starts with a basic description of the niobium–tin intermetallic. After that, it maps the influence of Sn content on the electron–phonon interaction strength and on the field–temperature phase boundary. The literature on the influence of Cu, Ti and Ta additions will then be summarized briefly. This is followed by a review of the effects of grain size and strain. The article concludes with a summary of the main results.}

abstract = {Supercapacitors are often modelled using electrical equivalent circuits with a limited number of branches. However, the limited number of branches often cannot explain long-term dynamics, and one therefore has to resort to more computationally challenging basic models governing diffusion and drift of ions. Here, it is shown that consistent modelling of a supercapacitor can be done in a straightforward manner by introducing a dynamic equivalent circuit model that naturally allows a large number or a continuous distribution of time constants, both in time and frequency domains. Such a model can be used to explain the most common features of a supercapacitor in a consistent manner. In the time domain, it is shown that the time-dependent charging rate and the self-discharge of a supercapacitor can both be interpreted in this model with either a few or a continuous distribution of relaxation times. In the frequency domain, the impedance spectrum allows one to extract a distribution of relaxation times. The unified model presented here may help visualizing how the distribution of relaxation times or frequencies govern the behaviour of a supercapacitor under varying circumstances.}

abstract = {The impedance of anode-supported single cells [ yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) anode;  cathode; 8YSZ electrolyte; area ] was characterized in a broad measuring range of temperature and air/fuel gas composition. The data has been analyzed by calculating the distribution function of relaxation times (DRTs). DRT computations enabled us to separate five different loss mechanisms occurring inside the cathode and anode without the need of an equivalent circuit. Two processes exhibit a systematic dependency on changes in the oxygen partial pressure of the cathode gas and thus can be attributed to diffusional and electrochemical losses on the cathode side. The remaining three processes are very sensitive to changes in the fuel gas but are not affected by variations of the cathode gas. These resistances are classified as a gas diffusion polarization within the anode–substrate and as an electro-oxidation reaction at the triple-phase boundary, respectively.}

The dynamic behavior of the cell under test, a Li-ion pouch cell with a graphite anode and a blend cathode, is characterized in an extremely broad frequency range from 100 kHz to 17 μHz. The introduced model gives predictions consistent with the experimental data, its accuracy depends on the assumed number of relaxation times respectively model order. Recommendations concerning application are given and limitations of the approach are discussed.}

abstract="Alloys for high temperature applications in an oxidizing environment depend on the formation of a protective and slow growing oxide scale. The composition of these alloys is such that a continuous layer of a thermodynamically stable oxide is formed through selective oxidation of one of the constituting elements. Then, the oxide layer forms a barrier between the environment and the underlying alloy. The alloys for high temperature applications can be divided into alumina (Al2O3), silica (SiO2), or chromia (Cr2O3) formers, such as stainless steels, superalloys (Reed 2006), and intermetallics (MX, where M is Ti, Fe, Co or Ni, and X denotes Al, Si, or Cr). These materials are successfully applied in for example gas turbine engines (aero, marine, and industrial), heating equipment and automotive converters etc. In this chapter, the focus will be on alumina forming alloys encountered as coating material for blades and vanes in gas turbine engines. However, the principles addressed also apply to the other mentioned classes of high temperature alloys.",

abstract = {Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is widely used in battery analysis as it is simple to implement and non-destructive. However, the data provided is a global representation of all electrochemical processes within the cell and much useful information is ambiguous or inaccessible when using traditional analysis techniques. This is a major challenge when EIS is used to analyse systems with complex cell chemistries, like lithium-sulfur (Li-S), one of the strongest candidates to supersede conventional Li-ion batteries. Here we demonstrate the application of distribution of relaxation times (DRT) analysis for quantitative deconvolution of EIS spectra from Li-S batteries, revealing the contributions of (eight) distinct electrode processes to the total cell polarisation. The DRT profile is shown to be strongly dependent on cell state-of-charge, offering a route to automated and on-board analysis of Li-S cells.}

abstract = {A high-resolution impedance study of the hydrogen oxidation in  (yttria-stabilized zirconia) cermet anodes has been realized in consideration of a broad range of operating conditions (temperature and partial pressure of fuel gas components , , , He). A major problem in this respect concerns the origin and physical interpretation of empirical equivalent circuits used to fit the experimental data. We applied a two-stage approach for the evaluation of the impedance data: (i) at first, by the deconvolution of a distribution function of relaxation times (DRT), four different processes and their characteristic relaxation times have been identified. Two processes at frequencies  represent a gas-conversion process or, respectively, a gas diffusion, whereas two processes at higher frequencies  are associated with the electro-oxidation of hydrogen at active sites, including the charge transfer reaction and the ionic transport. (ii) Subsequently, the last mentioned processes were fitted to a “transmission line” model describing the electronic and ionic transport properties of the  cermet. The high resolution of the DRT combined with the numeric accuracy of the complex nonlinear least square (CNLS) fit enabled us to determine (i) the effective ionic conductivity of the  cermet, (ii) the spatial extension of the electrochemically active area adjacent to the electrolyte/electrode interface, and (iii) the charge transfer resistance and its thermal activation energy.}

journal = {Journal of The Electrochemical Society},
abstract = {Niobium surfaces are commonly electropolished in an effort to obtain optimal smoothness for high-field superconducting radio-frequency cavity applications. We report the use of controlled electrochemical analysis techniques to characterize electropolishing of Nb in a sulfuric and hydrofluoric acid electrolyte. Through the use of a reference electrode, we are able to clearly distinguish the anode and cathode polarization potentials as well as the electrolyte voltage drop, which together sum to the applied power supply voltage. We then identify the temperature and HF concentration dependence of each potential. We also report the use of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) on this system. EIS results are consistent with the compact salt film mechanism for niobium electropolishing (EP) in this electrolyte and are not consistent with either the porous salt film or the absorbate-acceptor mechanism. Microscopic understanding of the basic Nb EP mechanism is expected to provide an appropriate foundation with which to optimize the preparation of high-field niobium cavity surfaces.}

abstract = {Linear electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and in particular its representation of distribution of relaxation time (DRT), enables the identification of the number of processes and their nature involved in electrochemical cells. With the advantage of high frequency resolution, DRT has recently drawn increasing attention for applications in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). However, the method of DRT reconstruction is not yet presented clearly in terms of what mathematical treatments and theoretical assumptions have been made. Here we present unambiguously a method to reconstruct DRT function of impedance based on Tikhonov regularization. By using the synthetic impedances and analytic DRT functions of RQ element, generalized finite length Warburg element, and Gerischer element with physical quantities representative to those of SOFC processes, we show that the quality of DRT reconstruction is sensitive to the sampling points per decade (ppd) of frequency from the impedance measurement. The robustness of the DRT reconstruction to resist noise imbedded in impedance data and numerical calculations can be accomplished by optimizing the weighting factor λ according to well defined criterion.}

  abstract     = {{The nitrogen doping (N-doping) process is applied to niobium (Nb) superconducting cavities to enhance their quality factors. The N-doping is followed by an electropolishing process that provides the final surface of the cavities. A controlled EP process is necessary to get the benefit of N-doping and achieve a high accelerating gradient. We have performed electropolishing of N-doped Nb surface under various conditions to understand their impact on the surface. A modified EP process was developed to obtain a smooth pit-free surface.}},

  abstract     = {{To improve the superconducting performance of niobium SRF cavities, electropolishing (EP) with a sulfuric and hydroflouric acid mixture is used. The chemistry of this reaction is complex due to the interactions between diffusion mechanisms, surface oxide structure, and multiple chemical species. Past studies on the EP process have produced a certain set of optimum parameters that have been used successfully for a long time. However, two recent developments have called the efficacy of the existing EP process into question. Since the introduction of nitrogen doping the surface quality of some cavities has been very poor. Also, EP performed at colder than standard temperatures leads to an increase in the cavity performance. To understand these questions, we perform a multivariate study on the EP process using niobium test samples electropolished at different temperatures and potentials. We find that electropolishing at lower potentials leads to rough surface features such as pitting and grain etching. Some of the surface features show similarities to features seen in niobium cavities. The effect of electropolishing temperature is not clear based on the results of this study.}},
